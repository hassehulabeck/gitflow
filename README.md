# A study in gitflow

## Three levels of branches

- main
- develop
- feature

## Why gitflow?

To secure main, by almost never pushing directly to main. Instead, we use a feature level where we write new code, then merge that feature into the develop branch. When that is fully tested, we can merge it into main.
